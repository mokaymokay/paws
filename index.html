        <h1>What is PAWS?</h1>
        <p>PAWS, an organization that brings together people who love animals and
          enjoy their company, leaves its paw print via a slew of activities.
          Especially worth noting is the PAWS Wildlife Center, which provides
          healthcare and rehabilitation to wild animals. </p>
